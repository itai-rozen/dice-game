## The most badass dice game you'll ever encounter.
### This game was built using react class-based components, html, css
## How to play
### Each player rolls the dice in his turn. 
### If the dice' numbers are not the same (1 2, 4 3, 6 1 etc) - the sum of dice is added to player's current turn. The player then has a choice either to end his turn and add current turn's score to his total score, or roll the dice again. But:
### If both dice have the same number - player loses all his points gained in current turn & turn is moved to oponnent.
### Winner is the player who gets to 100 first.

Bonus - players can change name & avatar in the settings menu. You can choose any character from the awesome Mortal Kombat II. In other words - choose your destiny.
Bonus II - turn on the sound! you'll enjoy some mesmerizing MKII SFX (toasty!) during the game.
